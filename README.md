# xor - IBM obfuscation stuff

`xor` encodes and decodes IBM obfuscated strings. Written in C as a learning
effort for the language.

## Compiling

Can be compiled on POSIX systems. Currently only on Cygwin using the 64 bits
MinGW GCC compiler, but should work on any C compiler (currently only using 
the standard library).
